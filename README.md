Iâ€™m a full stack junior developer and new graduate of an intensive 16 week bootcamp Makers Academy, a highly selective web development bootcamp. I love learning new things and helping others do the same. Loves problem solving and using technology to positively impact society. When I discovered coding, tried few online tutorials and knew I finally found a career path that ticked all the boxes: fast paced environment, challenges, real world problems to solve and continuous learning. And it is so much fun! I'm currently seeking my first role as a junior developer, where I can gain hands-on experience and contribute to the team.

#### Good Communication

- My experience at Makers Academy gave me constatnt practice on communication as part of a pair or a group working an a project and aided me in able to translate technical specifacations into deliverables.

#### Attention to Details and Precision 

- As a welder I had to be very detailed-orientated when completing the project. This was very important skill that helped to does not overlook anything and get unwanted effects. 
- During my projects I had to be very precise. A small mistake when welding could result in failure. Not only from money point of view but also serious personal injure. This has taught me a concentration and full attention at my work.
